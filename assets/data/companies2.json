By 1998, the GGLS program had expanded to new neighborhoods, including Imbaba, Abdeen, and Dar El Salam, supported by private funding from Save the Children. In July 2003, the three branches were merged into a single, independent program, which was renamed the Al Tadamun Microfinance Program and operated under the legal framework of WHIA.",
